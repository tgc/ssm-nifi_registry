## Description

Install and configure the [Apache NiFi
Registry](https://nifi.apache.org/registry.html) which manages shared
resources for Apache NiFi.

## Setup

### What nifi_registry affects

This module will download the Apache NiFi Registry tarball to
`/var/tmp/`.

The tarball will be unpacked to `/opt/nifi-registry` by default.

### Setup Requirements

NiFi Registry requires Java Runtime Environment. NiFi Registry 0.5.0
runs on Java 8, newer than 1.8.0_45.

When installing on local infrastructure, consider download the
distribution tarballs, validate them with the Apache distribution
keys, and store it on a local repository. Adjust the configuration
variables to point to your local repository. The [NiFi Registry
download page](https://nifi.apache.org/registry.html) also documents
how to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded files.

### Beginning with nifi_registry

Add dependency modules to your puppet environment:

- camptocamp/systemd
- puppet/archive
- puppetlabs/java (optional, you can install java yourself)
- puppetlabs/stdlib

## Usage

To download and install NiFi Registry, include the module. This will
download nifi registry, unpack it under
`/opt/nifi-registry/nifi-registry-<version>`, and start the service
with default configuration and storage locations.

```puppet
include nifi_registry
```
To host the file locally, add a nifi_registry::download_url variable for the
module.

```yaml
nifi_registry::download_url: "http://my-local-repo.example.com/apache/nifi-registry/0.5.0/nifi-registry-0.5.0-bin.tar.gz"
```

Please keep `nifi_registry::download_url`,
`nifi_registry::download_checksum` and `nifi_registry::version` in
sync. The URL, checksum and version should match. Otherwise, Puppet
will become confused.

## Limitations

This module is under development, and therefore somewhat light on
functionality.

Configuration is not managed yet. This can be managed outside the module
with `file` resources.

## Development

In the Development section, tell other users the ground rules for
contributing to your project and how they should submit their work.
